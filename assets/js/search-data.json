            "title": "A Summary on Atomic Habits",
            "content": ". I have been wanting to read this book for quite sometime now, and after seeing plenty of good reviews from people on twitter raving about how it has changed their lifestyle, I finally spent sometime reading this book. . The following were the main takeaways for me from this Book; . Chapter 1 - The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits . Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. | Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run. | Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential. | Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. | The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient. | An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results. | If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. | . Chapter 2 - How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) . Change can occur in 3 ways - outcome change, process change, and identity change. | The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become. | Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. | Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. | The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself. | . Chapter 3 - How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps . A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. | The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. | Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. | The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying. | . Chapter 4 - The man who didn’t look right . With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. | Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing. | The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them. | Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions. | The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior. | . Chapter 5 - The Best way to start a new habit . The 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious. | The two most common cues are time and location. | Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location. | The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. | Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit. | The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]. | .

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

I have been wanting to read this book for quite sometime now, and after seeing plenty of tweets from people across the spectrum on twitter raving about how it has changed their lifestyle, i finally spent sometime reading this book. . The following are the main takeaways from this, for me: . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
