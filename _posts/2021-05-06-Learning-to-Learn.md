**I always look forward to learn new things. The environment I have been around in my workplace have all been people who learnt things quickly and although I have asked them the secret on how they mastered a specific topic or a subject, it all came down to one thing**

**Well, what is it? Read on!**


    - Before going on to week one, lets take a look at what learning means :
    
    Learning involves physical changes in the nervous system, such as the strengthening of synapses, the activation of neural pathways, or the pruning of neural pathways. These changes elicit specific responses to environmental stimuli.

#### Week 1 -- Focussed Vs Diffused Thinking




Let me cut to the chase. It turns out, our brains use 2 methods to process information: focused and diffuse thinking.  
     
     
   - Focused thought
   

    Focused thinking is pretty straightforward—it’s focused. We use focused thinking when we are really concentrating on the matter at hand. Focused thinking is a highly attentive state of mind where the brain uses its best concentration abilities in the prefrontal cortex to ignore all extraneous information. It's also the preferred method for studying knowledge-intensive subjects.
    
    When we are in our focused mode of thinking, it’s like we have a one-track mind for the matter at hand. Distractions don’t exist. Whether we are practicing a specific skill like free-throws or slogging through a specific math problem, focused thinking allows us to zoom directly in on the most pertinent information.
    
    
    
   - Diffuse thought
    
    
    Diffuse thinking, on the other hand, looks at the big picture. Unlike focused thinking, diffuse thinking is all about distractions. Diffuse thinking happens when you let your mind wander freely, making connections at random. The diffuse mode of thinking does not happen on any one area of the brain, but rather all over. In fact, that is the beauty of diffuse thinking: your brain has the opportunity to connect the dots and link neural processes.

    Usually, diffuse thinking happens as you do other things. That’s why taking a shower or going for a run to take a break from studying can actually lead to an important breakthrough. While your conscious mind is relaxed, your brain is able to form a creative solution to a problem or finally link ideas that had been eluding you.
    
    
    Both types of thinking can be used to train the brain on a topic; they simply do so differently. To illustrate this point, consider a flashlight. You can have a concentrated beam of light that only illuminates a small area very brightly or you can have a less concentrated beam that illuminates a much broader area with a dimmer light.

    With focused thinking, your brain processes very specific information deeply; with diffuse thinking, the brain analyzes much more information at once but in less depth. Just like both flashlights will take you out of the dark, both modes of thinking will help you understand a subject better. Which one will work better for you simply depends on whether you want to see the big picture or small details.

     - So which one is ultimately better for learning: focused vs. diffuse thinking? As it turns out, neither.

     - While these two modes may seem to work in opposition to each other, both are required in order to master a topic or make progress on a difficult project. After all, when you are learning something new, you need to understand both the context for the information (diffuse) and the specifics of the subject (focused).


     - Alternating between focused and diffuse thinking is the best way to master a subject or solve a difficult problem. First, we use the focused mode of thinking to understand the basics of a topic without any distractions. Then we use the diffuse mode to passively internalize what we have learned and make connections to other things we already knew. Afterwards, we go back into focused mode and pare down the connections that we made to the best, most helpful ones.
     
     - Once you have repeated this process a few times, the information will really stick.
     
     
     - As it turns out, our brain probably has two modes for good reasons. We need them both in order to really process information that comes our way. So take advantage of them both when you’re learning to see better results. If nothing else, you finally have a scientific excuse to take that nap you want, which believe it or not is really needed to help you learn new subjects and topics.

### CONCLUSION:

The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements. This is a continuous process. There is no finish line. There is no permanent solution. Whenever you’re looking to improve, you can rotate through the Four Laws of Behavior Change until you find the next bottleneck. Make it obvious. Make it attractive. Make it easy. Make it satisfying. Round and round. Always looking for the next way to get 1 percent better.

It’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t stop. It’s remarkable the business you can build if you don’t stop working. It’s remarkable the body you can build if you don’t stop training. It’s remarkable the knowledge you can build if you don’t stop learning. It’s remarkable the fortune you can build if you don’t stop saving. It’s remarkable the friendships you can build if you don’t stop caring. Small habits don’t add up. They compound. That’s the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes. Remarkable results.
