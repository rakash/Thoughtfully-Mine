I have been wanting to read this book for quite sometime now, and after seeing plenty of good reviews from people on twitter raving about how it has changed their lifestyle, I finally spent sometime reading this book. 

The following were the main takeaways for me from this Book;

## Chapter 1 - The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

  - **Habits** are the compound interest of self-improvement. 
  - Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.
  - Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential. 
  - Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. 
  - The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.
  - An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.
  - If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.


## Chapter 2 - How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

  - Change can occur in 3 ways - outcome change, process change, and identity change. 
  - The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
  - Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
  - Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
  - The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.
  
## Chapter 3 - How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

  - A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. 
  - The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.
  - Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.
  - The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.

## Chapter 4 - The man who didn't look right

  - With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.
  - Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.
  - The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.
  - Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.
  - The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.
  
## Chapter 5 - The Best way to start a new habit

  - The 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious.
  - The two most common cues are time and location.
  - Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location.
  - The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].
  - Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.
  - The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].


## Chapter 6 - Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
