-- # CHAPTERS

I have been wanting to read this book for quite sometime now, and after seeing plenty of good reviews from people on twitter raving about how it has changed their lifestyle, I finally spent sometime reading this book. 

The following were the main takeaways for me from this from this Book;

## Chapter 1:

    - **Habits** are the compound interest of self-improvement. 
    - Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.
    - Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential. 
    - Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. 
    - The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.
    - An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.
    - If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.


## Chapter 2

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:

## Code

You can format text and code per usual 

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```

Formatting text as shell commands:

```shell
echo "hello world"
./some_script.sh --option "value"
wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png
```

Formatting text as YAML:

```yaml
key: value
- another_key: "another value"
```
