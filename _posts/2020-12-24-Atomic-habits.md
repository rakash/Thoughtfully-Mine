I have been wanting to read this book for quite sometime now, and after seeing plenty of tweets from people across the spectrum on twitter raving about how it has changed their lifestyle, i finally spent sometime reading this book. 

The following are the main takeaways from this, for me: 

## Basic setup

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:

## Lists

Here's a list:

- item 1
- item 2

And a numbered list:

1. item 1
1. item 2

## Boxes and stuff

> This is a quotation

{% include alert.html text="You can include alert boxes" %}

...and...

{% include info.html text="You can include info boxes" %}

## Images

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/logo.png "fast.ai's logo")

## Code

You can format text and code per usual 

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```

    2

Formatting text as shell commands:

```shell
echo "hello world"
./some_script.sh --option "value"
wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png
```

Formatting text as YAML:

```yaml
key: value
- another_key: "another value"
```


## Tables

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|-|-|
| A thing | Another thing |
